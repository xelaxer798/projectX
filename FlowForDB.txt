when a nodeData entry comes from the auduino it will send along with its data is its serial number 
which in the database is classified as the nodeId. That nodeId can then look up in the table nodeLists, 
the nodeListId can be used to find all the nodes in a ceritan room. It can also be
used to pull the userId from the foriegn key in the rooms Table. 
As of right now with now the tables are set up this is how the flow work. 
I have included the files of how the tables are set up in the attachments .
